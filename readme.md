# Baldera Reborn
Updated version for patch 100.02 support.

**Baldera Reborn** focuses on making the region of Baldera feel a little more lively. This has been accomplished by using the [TERA Toolbox](https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-toolbox) modding platform to add clientside NPCs to the game. I've taken dialog from all over the game, and spliced it together to create a personal artistic interpretation of what Baldera _may_ have been in its prime.

Currently, Baldera Reborn features a fully populated city, and both camps. However, nature outside of these areas is lacking NPCs. If there's enough interest, I will be more than willing to expand upon what is provided, adding NPCs to areas that lack them; and potentially even looking into adding monsters if possible. Regardless, what exists is a fully usable form of my original goal. There's a grim reality to Baldera's fate, and why the seal was put in place north of Arcadia in the first place. Will you uncover the secrets, and piece together the story of Baldera's last stand? Or, will you draw your own conclusions? The tale is yours to tell.


## Features

Baldera Reborn offers the following features:

* **150+** total NPCs and objects to help Baldera feel more alive.

* The NPCs are in the main city, and in both camps surrounding Baldera.

* A story with an intended premise, but not defined enough to kill a user's creativity to interpret the material.

* Spliced dialog for **90+** custom NPCs from all over the game to achieve the general "plot" premise.

* Valkyon soldiers have been seen tinkering with a mysterious object near the Baldera seal... Maybe you should investigate?


## Usage Notes

1. **This module may not fit everyone's definition of "ethical".**

     a. For example, this mod provides a way to access Baldera from its natural entrance at the north end of Arcadia.
     
     b. This is accomplished by using a shuttle, aka a moving platform.
     
     c. That said, **use this module at your own risk.**

2. **Despite potentially not being 100% ethical to some, this mod takes steps to ensure your safety.** There are a few systems in place to ensure that no invalid data is sent to the server. If even one of those checks fail, the mod will not function. If this is the case and you aren't comfortable editing code, please wait for an update.

3. **The NPCs spawned are FAKE.** This means that they are fully clientside, and only you can see them assuming you have the mod. Other people, even with the mod, won't see them acknowledge you whatsoever. This is a byproduct of the way the NPCs are spawned. This also means it's safe in that regard, others can't see you talking to fake NPCs.

4. **With all Toolbox modules, use caution when talking about it in-game.** I won't say that this module is 100% safe, but it should be at least 99.99% safe as long as you use common sense. Don't use the shuttle when other people you don't know are around, and don't tell people that you have NPCs added to the game.


## Additional Mods
